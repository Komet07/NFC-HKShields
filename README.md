# NFC-HKShields
Shields mod for Nebulous: Fleet Command. Mainly created for the Star Wars: Armada Command mod, but ideally should be modular and available for everyone to implement into their own mods

# How to set up (WIP)
## Installation
Download the latest version of the StarWarsShields .dll and set it up in your unity project (WIP)

## Setting up a basic shield


## Adding your shield to the mod
To add the shield to the mod, add it to your manifest the same as you would with any HullComponent.

## Adding HKShields as a dependency
To properly work and avoid any unwanted errors / compatability issues, please do not package the StarWarsShields dll into your own mod - instead, add it as a dependency. 
(WIP)
